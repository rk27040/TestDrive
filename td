Someone sent me messages yesterdya do just thought of giving clarification on few things. One of the reason for leaving group was someone made a comment "shame" on me and I considered it as a personal attack and felt bad reading it on my birthday. I am old enough not to take political topics at personal level but I'd definetely will not accept any personal attacks. The main other reason levaing group was, I am feeling guilty now a days for not helping my daughter college applications much and wahtsapp is taking too much time. I just thought of staying away from groups for few months. I hope you guys can understand. No further discussion on this topic please...
