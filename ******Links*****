1.	When congress was dividing state, he suppressed the AP agitation that state will not be divided. He failed completely negotiating with his own government and did not put any demands on table. Now he still talks about what happened in parliament to divert people minds
2.	When he was contesting against Murali Mohan, TDP distributed 100 rupees per vote where YSR distributed 150 rupees per vote for him in his constituency. What values he had at that time? He is talking like Gandhi now.

He projects himself as Gandhi where his original character is - - --
